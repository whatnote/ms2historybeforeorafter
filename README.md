### Why This Project?

I created this game for the Interactive Frontend Development project. The project scope was to create the game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the core focus being the functional logic created with JavaScript.

There was a choice of three different projects. My weakest area of JavaScript was with understanding functions and how they can be called or passed to other functions. This was a major aspect of the **_Simon_** game project, so choosing this project would enable me to develop my weakest area. I learnt a lot during the course of the project, and it has definitely helped me to stregthen my weakest area.
