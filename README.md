<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p><strong>Balsamiq</strong></p>
<p>Balsamiq was used to create wireframes of both the mobile phone and website before construction began.</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
<p>HTML is used to create the landing webpage for my game.</p>

<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>
<p>The project uses CSS to apply the custom styles. The index.html file is linked directly to the main.css stylesheet.</p>

<p><strong>Bootstrap</strong></p>
<p>The project uses the Bootstrap framework to add a responsive grid system. I then layer my own css to custonise the style</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>The project uses JavaScript from my custom script.js file to add functionality and interactivity to my game. This is the core focus of this project.</p>

<p><strong>Google Fonts</strong></p>
<p>The project uses Google Fonts to style the text.
  
<p><strong>Jasmine</strong></p>
<p>The project uses Test Driven Development (TDD) using the Jasmine framework to automate some testing of my JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Version Control</strong></p>

<p><strong>Git</strong></p>
<p>I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong></p>

I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website/app in a live environment.</p>

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
