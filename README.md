## About

This game is aimed at anyone who has an interest in History. The pub quizzer, child, parent, someone who wants to learn about history. 
It’s a spin on the classic card game higher or lower; A fun way approach learning about history, you can just play the game; did a historical event happen before or after the preceding card. You can use your knowledge or just guess the year of the event. 
If the player wants to, they can then click for more info, where a short paragraph explains the event,  additionally click the link to a website that discusses the event in much greater detail

### Why This Project?

I created this game for the Interactive Frontend Development project. The project scope was to create the game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the core focus being the functional logic created with JavaScript.

There was a choice of three different projects. My weakest area of JavaScript was with understanding functions and how they can be called or passed to other functions. This was a major aspect of the **_Simon_** game project, so choosing this project would enable me to develop my weakest area. I learnt a lot during the course of the project, and it has definitely helped me to stregthen my weakest area.

#### Game-Controls
### Features-Left-To-Implement
## Technologies-Used

[**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com/)
- Balsamiq was used to create wireframes of both the mobile phone and website before construction began.

[HTML]()
- HTML is used to create the landing webpage for my game.

[CSS]()
- The project uses CSS to apply the custom styles. The index.html file is linked directly to the main.css stylesheet.

[Bootstrap]()
- The project uses the Bootstrap framework to add a responsive grid system. I then layered my own css to customise the style. 

[JavaScript]()
- The project uses JavaScript from my custom script.js file to add functionality and interactivity to my game. This is the core focus of this project.
